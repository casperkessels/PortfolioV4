Since the start of 2019, together with 5 friends, I have been involved with organising a fully electric motorcycle racing competition.
Our mission is to accelerate the development of electric mobility. We want to achieve that by creating a platform for sustainable research and innovation. And at the same time by inspiring people to adopt electric mobility by showing that it is fast, fun, and exciting.

These two values have to be reflected by the brand identity. So we set out to create a branding around this. First, we had to come up with a name. After that, I created a logo, color scheme, website, and marketing materials to promote it.

Name
First the name. We believe the core principle of our competition is that it is open. By limiting the technical restrictions, we allow participating teams to truly innovate in the field of electric mobility to become faster than the competitors.

We also want to give it the same allure as any other established racing competition.

It has to be very easy to remember. People have to assume the name from the logo.

Should not infringe or be close to other brand names

Open eSBK

Logo
I first looked at similar organisations like Formula e and xxx. I then looked at the context in which the designs would be used which is very broad, from big physical prints, to small logoâ€™s on videos. Electric and innovation are represented by a bright blue color.
The logo had to be simple and self explanatory.
